An **inverted yield curve** describes the unusual drop of yields on **longer-term debt** below yields on **short-term debt** of the same credit quality.

Sometimes referred to as a negative yield curve, the inverted curve has proven in the past to be a relatively reliable lead indicator of a **recession**.
