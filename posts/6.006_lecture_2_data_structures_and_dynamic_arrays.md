### Data Structures and Dynamic Arrays

#### Interface(API/ADT)    
- specification                 
- what data can store           
- what operation are supported & what they mean
- problems
- abstraction                  

#### Data Structure
- representation
- how to store data
- algorithm to support operations
- solutions
- implementation

#### Two main interfaces
- Set
- Sequence  [5, 2, 9, 7]

#### Two main DS approaches
- arrays
- pointer based
